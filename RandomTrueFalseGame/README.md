If the user selects the correct answer, his/her score and the number of questions are incremented, else, just the number of questions are incremented.

This was done as a part of Udacity's Online React NanoDegree program. The possible solution folder contains the solution from Udacity and the src folder contains my own solution. Currently, the application uses my solution.
