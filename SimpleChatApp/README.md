## Description

In this project, the goal was to create a simple chat application where two chat windows are displayed on the screen. Two users for the two chat windows are Amy and John. Both the users can type their chat messages and they are shown in both the windows with the name of the user who typed that message. For the lists of messages shown to both users, the messages written by the user himself/herself is shown in green and the message written by received from the other user is shown the blue. The send button gets disabled when the text box is empty and gets enabled as soon as something is entered in the text box.
